## Summary
Males had the largest amount of rides, especially the subscribers. The most popular times for a ride seem to be during rush hour on the weekdays (8-9am or 5-7pm). Additional visualizations that could take place would be to look at the duration of rides for non male users to target for marketing. Another visualization could be to show the number of new riders by gender and by date.
