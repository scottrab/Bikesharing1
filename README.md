# Bikesharing

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to show the length of time bikes were checked out by gender, the number of bike trips per rider & gender per hour, and the number of bike trips per user & gender for each day of week.

    --The peak hours in August were 8-9am and 5-7pm. 

## Summary
Male subscribers take the most rides.  The most popular times for a ride, to no surprise, are during rush hour on weekdays.  Additional visualizations that could take place would be to look at the duration of rides for non male users to target for marketing. Another visualization could be to show the number of new riders by gender and by date.
